# Open Classrooms Project 7 - Restaurant Review Site

### Hello and thanks for stopping by!

This repo contains *Open Classrooms Project 7 - Restaurant Review Site*. The purpose of this project was to create our own restaurant review website, using the **GoogleMaps JavaScript API**.

The given tasks included:

* Loading a GoogleMap via the API that shows the users current geolocation
* Displaying nearby restaurants as markers on the map and a corresponding list in a column
* List details for each restaurants such as rating and reviews, streetview photo, and contact details
* Allow users to add reviews to existing restaurants
* Allow users to add new restaurants via clicking a location on the map
* Allow users to filter restaurants displayed, based on rating

This project was to be bult with **ReactJS** and **HTML/CSS**. Most students chose to use an NPM third party library such as *google-react-map*. I chose to approach the project from a pure ReactJS angle. Although this approach made the project much more difficult and lengthy, it gave me a deeper understanding of both ReactJS and the GoogleMaps API than I would otherwise have gotten.

**Please note:**
If you would like to clone this repo, you will need to insert your own API key to access GoogleMaps API. The API key in use is restricted to this URL and has a request quota placed on it. Usage per day is restricted to a small amount of requests per user for security purposes.

**COMING SOON** To view the **technical documentation** for this project, please see the wiki [here](https://github.com/TamiMcInnis/restaurant-review-site/wiki "Restaurant Review Site wiki").

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
